# Wine-Quality-Prediction
In this project, our objective is to predict the quality of wine on the basis of various criteria like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol. During Model evaluation, used the Random Forest Classifier Machine Alogorithm for prediction.
